This project demonstrates the use of **Terraform** to provision and manage AWS infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).  
It was created as a hands-on DevOps learning project and follows Terraform best practices and workflows.

## 🚀 Overview

The infrastructure is provisioned on **AWS** and includes:
